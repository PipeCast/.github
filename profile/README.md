# PipeCast
From the maker of the GoXLR Utility, introducing PipeCast. Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gKVREmSwTh)

## What is it?
PipeCast is an attempt to utilise pipewire to bring common functionality present in various audio devices focused on Broadcasting as Streaming to Linux. The goal is to bring virtual devices, mixes, submixes and routing to your desktop in an easy to use way.

### Status
As of right now everything is in a prototype phase. Code is being built to create the nodes, filters, and links prior to it being presented as an API service, but progress is being made:

### Objective
The goal is to allow any microphone and / or any headset to be involved in the routing. In addition, I'll be investigating potential LV2 plugins to provide functionality such as Noise Gates, Expanders, Compressors, EQ, and the like on any microphone,
and as the API will be open I'll also be investigating the ability to attach Stream Decks and other devices as API consumers.

## WHEN?!
I can't really say, development is as development does.. I'm actively using and testing the prototype code before this becomes a much larger project, so lets see where it takes us :)
